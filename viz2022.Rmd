## Welcome!

This tutorial will demonstrate how to create basic figures in R

To follow along with the workshop in R, you will need to have **already installed** R and R Studio

---

## How to follow along and participate

* Open R Studio

* Install `tidyverse`, `gghalves`, and `haven` if you do not have them already

* Open the workshop R Markdown file and click on the **tiny** green arrow on the top right corner of the gray shaded area (this is a code chunk!) that contains this: 

```{r eval = FALSE}

library(package = "tidyverse")
library(package = "haven")
library(package = "gghalves")

```

* The arrow will run all the code in that "chunk" of code

---

## The data set

* We will be using the **Global Attitudes & Trends** data set from the **Pew Internet & American Life** website 

    + If needed, download the data and documentation from this website: <a href = "https://www.pewresearch.org/global/datasets/">https://www.pewresearch.org/global/datasets/</a>
    
---

## Importing data into R

* Before running this code, make sure the participant file and the data file are saved in the same folder on your computer with the file called `Participant documents.Rproj`

* Use the little green arrow at the top of the code chunk to run this code

```{r echo = FALSE}

# use read_spss function to read the spss file 
globalData2019 <- read_spss(file = "Participant documents/Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Spring 2019 Dataset WEB.sav")

```

```{r eval = FALSE}

# use read_spss function to read the spss file 
globalData2019 <- read_spss(file = "Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Spring 2019 Dataset WEB.sav")

```

---

## Data cleaning 

* Run the next code chunk (`chunk3`), which uses `tidyverse` to clean the data set so it is ready to visualize

```{r}
globalData2019clean <- globalData2019 %>%
  filter(country %in% c(16, 21, 26, 34)) %>%

## Using the ggplot2 package for plotting

* Part of the `tidyverse` set of packages in R

* `gg` stands for **grammar** of **graphics**

* Plots created in `ggplot2` are built in layers 

* Let's look at some examples

* First, a bar chart...

---

`r chunk_reveal("my_bar", widths = c(1,1), title = "## Basic bar chart")`

```{r my_bar, include = FALSE}
globalData2019clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = SEX)) +
  geom_bar() 
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("my_bar_fancy", widths = c(1,1), title = "## Fancy bar chart")`

```{r my_bar_fancy, include = FALSE}
globalData2019clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = SEX)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "deeppink") +
  labs(x = "Sex",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Sex of 5001 participants in a 2019 survey of people from Kenya,\nNigeria, South Africa, and the United States.") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("my_bar_fancy_colors", widths = c(1,1), title = "## Fancy bar chart with colors")`

```{r my_bar_fancy_colors, include = FALSE}
globalData2019clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = SEX, fill = SEX)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Sex",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Sex of 5001 participants in a 2019 survey of\npeople from Kenya, Nigeria,\nSouth Africa, and the United States.") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

---

`r chunk_reveal("my_bar_fancy_legend", widths = c(1,1), title = "## Super fancy bar chart")`

```{r my_bar_fancy_legend, include = FALSE}
globalData2019clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = SEX, fill = SEX)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Sex",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Sex of 5001 participants in a 2019 survey of\npeople from Kenya, Nigeria,\nSouth Africa, and the United States.") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14, base_family = "serif") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

---

## You try it!

Make a bar chart of the `BETTER_GENDER` responses from survey participants.

Edit the code below to: 

* Use `BETTER_GENDER` as the fill variable in the `ggplot()` layer

* Change the color of the bars by replacing "Set2" with the name of another palette (hint: palette names can be found by using the Help tab and entering scale_fill_brewer)

* Add labels for the axes and a title inside the quote marks (see codebook for more about the question)

* Replace `theme_minimal()` with another theme, you can find them by typing `theme_` into the Help tab

* Play with the `base_size = ` by trying different numbers

When you have completed the changes, click the little green arrow on the top right of the code chunk to run the code.

`r chunk_reveal("you-try", widths = c(1,1), title = "## You try it example")`

```{r you-try, eval = F, echo = F}
globalData2019clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = BETTER_GENDER, fill = BETTER_GENDER)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Who has better life",
       y = "Frequency",
       title = "Opinion on quality of life by gender for\n5001 participants in a 2019 survey of people from Kenya,\nNigeria, South Africa, and the United States.") +

       title = "Who has a better life by sex according to 5001 participants\nin a 2019 survey of people from Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa,\nand the United States.",
       fill = "Survey participant sex") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12, base_family = "serif") 
```

---

## You try it!

* Create a grouped bar plot for Figure 2 with `COUNTRY_SATIS` as the x-axis and `SEX` as the fill color 

* Drop the `NA` values for `COUNTRY_SATIS`

* Add good labels for the x-axis, y-axis, title (may need the codebook for this)

* Format it using a palette you like  

* Fix the legend title so it is "Participant sex"

```{r}
# Figure 2 code goes here

```

## The final challenges...choose one or try them all!

* Make a bar graph showing percentage of participants in each category of ECON_SIT 

* Create a figure that shows grouped bar plots for GLOBAL_COMMUNITY grouped by country

* Create a figure that shows grouped bar plots for country and COUNTRY_SATIS

* Create a figure that shows grouped bar plots for COUNTRY_SATIS grouped by country and SEX

* Create a figure that shows the distribution of AGE by country and SEX
